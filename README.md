This was originally a part of my app for testing html/css templates by previewing them, looking at the code inside the app, and editing the code by having blank lines and comments removed. Then, last but not least, sending the template to your own devises.

However, ln light of this probably not being what you are doing, it can just as easily be used for any app that keeps a relatively short list of email addresses.

Data can be stored with your prefered technology, including a simple backend database which I have included in my github repos.
